# Smart-Auto-State-Machine-Prototype
The same like "Smart Auto Prototype", but now we have the state machine, just to be a comparison, i'll still do  the other one

## Intro
just a comparison between the "Non State Machine", i made 2 so i can learn something and know which is efficient and not....

i'll be back after commiting and modifying this one and the other one
